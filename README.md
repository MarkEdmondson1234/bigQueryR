# bigQueryR
R Interface with Google BigQuery.

Very experimental.

For most purposes it would be best if you use [bigrquery](https://github.com/hadley/bigrquery) instead.

## Why this package then?

This package is here as it uses [googleAuthR](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAuthR) as backend, so has Shiny support, and compatibility with other googleAuthR dependent packages
